Introduction to the App

Welcome to our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) â€“ a snapshot of the exciting journey we are embarking on! Our app is a testament to our commitment to delivering a foundational version that showcases its core functionality.
For more detailed information about the tasks and objectives of our project, please refer to https://docs.google.com/document/d/12xnPbwdlEqgeXUmJTMQp9PNNRMeLp_QwARce_czqmgc/edit

Current State:
While we proudly present our MVP, we acknowledge that there's room for growth and refinement. The architecture is a work in progress, with plans to modularize it into independent units. We are actively working to enhance error handling, improve the 'Forgot' functionality, revamp the user menu for a smoother experience, and elevate the survey screen to meet your expectations.

Under the Hood:
Behind the scenes, our app operates on the MVVM architecture, embracing the latest technologies. Compose tests and Mockito tests ensure the reliability of our codebase, while API calls bring dynamic data to your fingertips. We prioritize the security of your information through safe key storage practices.

User Interface:
Our app's user interface is crafted with Jetpack Compose, offering a modern and intuitive design. Despite the current limitations, we are committed to evolving the interface to meet the evolving needs of our users.

As we evolve, your feedback becomes invaluable. We appreciate your understanding as we strive to deliver a seamless and feature-rich experience. Stay tuned for updates, enhancements, and a more robust version in the near future!

Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey!
